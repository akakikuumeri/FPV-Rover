# FPV-Rover
A small robot on wheels with a movable video camera and other features to roam around in parks and interact with people.

Implements a cool PID controller with a gyroscope to help the robot steer straight even on slippery or bumby surfaces. Works very well, better than rotational encoders on wheels!
